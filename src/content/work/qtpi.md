[Qtpi](https://qtpi.app) (Cutie Pie) is an innovative dating and relationship platform engineered
to fundamentally redefine how people connect, moving beyond the
engagement-driven, often unethical models of traditional dating apps. As a
solo-founded venture, Qtpi is built on a core philosophy that technology can
be ethical, embedding values of Privacy, Agency, and Thoughtfulness
directly into its architecture.

The platform addresses the ineffectiveness of online dating through a
game-theory-backed approach. Its unique "Pledge System" ensures high-intent
interactions by requiring mutual commitment for matches. Crucially, Qtpi
extends beyond initial connections, with planned offerings such as an integrated 
"Relationship Toolkit"—including a Shared Scrapbook and Date Scheduler—to support
couples throughout their entire relationship journey, transforming churn into
long-term engagement.

## Technical Foundation
Built on a robust, modular architecture, the platform utilizes Django (DRF)
for the backend, Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, and
self-hosted Keycloak and Matrix for secure identity and end-to-end encrypted
communication. This privacy-by-design stack ensures user control and data
integrity.

## AI-Augmented Development Strategy:
Leveraged AI (Gemini, Kiro) to learn app development while building and increase development spped.
