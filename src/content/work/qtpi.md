[Qtpi](https://qtpi.app) (Cutie Pie) is an innovative dating and relationship platform engineered
to fundamentally redefine how people connect, moving beyond the
engagement-driven, often unethical models of traditional dating apps. As a
solo-founded venture, Qtpi is built on a core philosophy that technology can
be ethical art, embedding values of Privacy, Agency, and Thoughtfulness
directly into its architecture.

The platform addresses the ineffectiveness of online dating through a
game-theory-backed approach. Its unique "Pledge System" ensures high-intent
interactions by requiring mutual commitment for matches. Crucially, Qtpi
extends beyond initial connections, with planned offerings such as an integrated 
"Relationship Toolkit"—including a Shared Scrapbook and Date Scheduler—to support
couples throughout their entire relationship journey, transforming churn into
long-term engagement.

Underpinned by a robust, privacy-by-design tech stack featuring self-hosted
end-to-end encrypted messaging and identity management, Qtpi is a testament
to building a more humane and effective way for people to connect. It's a
protest against systems that disrespect users' time, fostering genuine,
lasting relationships through thoughtful design and aligned incentives.
