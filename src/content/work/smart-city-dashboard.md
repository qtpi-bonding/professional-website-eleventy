Built a comprehensive analytics dashboard that aggregates real-time data from city infrastructure to support evidence-based urban planning and policy decisions. The platform integrates data from traffic sensors, energy grids, public transportation, and citizen services.

## Technical Architecture

The dashboard uses a microservices architecture with real-time data processing capabilities. WebSocket connections enable live updates while a caching layer ensures fast response times even with large datasets.

## Policy Integration

Worked closely with city planners and policy makers to ensure the dashboard provides actionable insights for urban governance. The interface includes policy scenario modeling and impact assessment tools.

## Deployment Impact

Successfully deployed in Austin, TX, where it supports daily operations for traffic management, energy planning, and emergency response coordination. The platform has reduced response times for city services by 25%.
