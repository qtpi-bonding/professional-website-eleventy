Designed and deployed a network of IoT sensors for continuous environmental monitoring across multiple field sites. The system collects real-time data on air quality, temperature, humidity, and soil conditions to support environmental research and policy decisions.

## System Architecture

The monitoring network uses low-power IoT devices connected via LoRaWAN to transmit data to a central processing system. Data is stored in InfluxDB and visualized through custom Grafana dashboards.

## Research Applications

Data from this network has supported multiple research projects and has been used to inform local environmental policy decisions. The system demonstrates the potential for IoT technology to enhance environmental science research.
