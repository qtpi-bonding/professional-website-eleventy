title: "Constructing the Mechanism of Dinoflagellate Luciferin Bioluminescence Using Computation"
description: "This study uses computational methods to elucidate the mechanism and intermediates of dinoflagellate luciferin bioluminescence. Simulations identify a dioxetanol intermediate as the chemiexcitation source, with predicted spectra supporting the proposed mechanism and guiding future stereoisomer experiments."
