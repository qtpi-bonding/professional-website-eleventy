This paper presents a comprehensive framework for implementing algorithmic accountability measures within federal agencies. Through analysis of existing governance structures and stakeholder interviews, we propose practical guidelines for AI system oversight and transparency.

## Abstract

As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into government operations, the need for robust governance frameworks becomes critical. This study examines current practices across federal agencies and proposes a standardized approach to AI accountability that balances innovation with public trust.

## Key Findings

- Current AI governance practices vary significantly across agencies
- Standardized frameworks can improve both efficiency and accountability
- Technical and policy expertise must be integrated for effective implementation
