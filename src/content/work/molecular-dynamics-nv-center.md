title: "Large-Scale Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics for Assessing Stabilities of Near-Surface NV Centers"
description: "This study uses ab initio molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical analysis to reveal the stability and electronic properties of near-surface nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. The results show that NV centers near the 111 surface are energetically favorable and remain stable up to 1000 Â°C, offering insights for next-generation quantum sensors."
