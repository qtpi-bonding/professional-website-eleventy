Developed a comprehensive web platform that enables researchers and policymakers to visualize and analyze climate data from multiple sources. The platform integrates real-time data feeds with historical datasets to provide actionable insights for climate adaptation planning.

## Technical Implementation

Built using modern web technologies with a focus on performance and accessibility. The backend processes large climate datasets using Python and PostgreSQL, while the frontend provides interactive visualizations using React and D3.js.

## Impact

The platform has been adopted by three federal agencies and is used by over 500 researchers worldwide for climate impact assessment and policy development.
