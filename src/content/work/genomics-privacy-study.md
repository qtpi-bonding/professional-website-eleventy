This interdisciplinary study examines the intersection of genomic research, privacy-preserving technologies, and regulatory frameworks. We analyze current technical approaches to protecting genomic privacy and propose policy recommendations for balancing research benefits with individual privacy rights.

## Abstract

Genomic research holds tremendous promise for advancing personalized medicine and understanding human health, but it also raises significant privacy concerns. This paper evaluates emerging privacy-preserving technologies including differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation in the context of genomic data analysis.

## Key Contributions

- Comprehensive technical evaluation of privacy-preserving genomic analysis methods
- Policy framework for regulating genomic data use while enabling research
- Recommendations for international coordination on genomic privacy standards
- Case studies from three major biobanks implementing privacy technologies

## Impact

This work has informed policy discussions at NIH and FDA regarding genomic data governance and has been cited in congressional testimony on biotechnology regulation.
