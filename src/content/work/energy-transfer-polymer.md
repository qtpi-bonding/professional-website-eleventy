title: "Energy Transfer Mechanisms in Large Low-Bandgap Polymers from Time-Resolved Experiments and Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics Calculations"
description: "This work combines time-resolved spectroscopy and large-scale nonadiabatic molecular dynamics to uncover how molecular vibrations drive energy transfer in a new narrow bandgap conjugated polymer. The insights reveal tunable chemical features that can enhance infrared light harvesting and other low-bandgap polymer applications."
