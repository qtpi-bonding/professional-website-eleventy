Developed a sophisticated agent-based modeling framework that enables policymakers to simulate the potential impacts of proposed policies before implementation. The system models complex interactions between different stakeholder groups and predicts policy outcomes with quantified uncertainty.

## Technical Innovation

The framework combines traditional agent-based modeling with machine learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy. It uses historical policy data to train models that can simulate realistic stakeholder behavior and policy responses.

## Policy Applications

Successfully used to model healthcare policy reforms, environmental regulations, and technology adoption policies. The framework has been adopted by two state governments and three federal agencies for policy impact assessment.

## Research Impact

The methodology has been presented at major policy conferences and is being adapted for international development policy analysis. The open-source framework has been downloaded over 1,000 times by researchers worldwide.
