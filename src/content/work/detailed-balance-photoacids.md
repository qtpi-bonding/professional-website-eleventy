title: "Detailed-Balance Limits for Sunlight-to-Protonic Energy Conversion from Aqueous Photoacids and Photobases Based on Reversible Mass-Action Kinetics"
description: "This work models sunlight-to-protonic energy conversion in water sensitized by photoacids or photobases, identifying limits to photovoltage and power conversion efficiency. Simulations reveal optimal dye properties and excited-state lifetimes that maximize protonic quasi-chemical potentials, providing design guidelines for light-driven protonic devices."
