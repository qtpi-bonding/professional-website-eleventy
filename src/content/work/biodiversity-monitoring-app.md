Developed a mobile application that empowers citizen scientists to contribute to biodiversity monitoring efforts through automated species identification and data collection. The app uses machine learning to identify species from photos and integrates with research databases.

## Technical Innovation

The app implements on-device machine learning using TensorFlow Lite for real-time species identification, reducing the need for internet connectivity in remote field locations. Cloud synchronization ensures data reaches research databases when connectivity is available.

## Scientific Impact

Over 10,000 users have contributed more than 50,000 species observations, significantly expanding the geographic coverage of biodiversity monitoring efforts. Data from the app has been used in 5 peer-reviewed publications on species distribution and climate impacts.

## Community Engagement

The app includes educational features that help users learn about local ecosystems while contributing to scientific research. Gamification elements encourage continued participation and data quality.
