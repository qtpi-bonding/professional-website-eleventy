# Kiro Specs Directory

This directory contains Kiro specifications for features and enhancements.

## Active Specs

Currently no active specs. New feature specifications will be created here as needed.

## Archived Specs

Completed specifications are moved to the `archived/` directory:

- `archived/personal-portfolio-website/` - Initial website setup and structure
- `archived/mobile-responsive-enhancements/` - Mobile responsive behavior implementation

## Creating New Specs

To create a new spec:

1. Use Kiro's spec creation feature
2. Define requirements, design, and implementation tasks
3. Work through the implementation iteratively
4. Archive the spec when complete

## Spec Structure

Each spec typically contains:
- `requirements.md` - Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Design decisions and technical approach
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks and progress tracking
