# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing personal portfolio website with improved mobile responsiveness and sidebar management. The enhancement focuses on making the sidebar hideable on all screen sizes and ensuring the website is fully usable on mobile devices. The current website has a fixed sidebar layout that may not work well on smaller screens, and users need the ability to hide/show the sidebar for better content viewing.

## Glossary

- **Portfolio_Website**: The existing personal portfolio website built with Eleventy
- **Sidebar**: The left navigation panel containing personal information, filters, and section navigation
- **Mobile_Viewport**: Screen sizes below 768px width (typical mobile devices)
- **Tablet_Viewport**: Screen sizes between 768px and 1024px width
- **Desktop_Viewport**: Screen sizes above 1024px width
- **Hamburger_Menu**: A three-line icon used to toggle sidebar visibility
- **Overlay**: A semi-transparent background that appears behind the sidebar on mobile
- **Touch_Target**: Interactive elements sized appropriately for finger navigation (minimum 44px)
