# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes the sidebar behavior issues in the personal portfolio website. The current implementation has problems with hamburger menu visibility, toggle button functionality, and preference persistence. The goal is to create a simple, predictable sidebar behavior that works consistently across all device types without storing user preferences.

## Glossary

- **Portfolio_Website**: The existing personal portfolio website built with Eleventy
- **Sidebar**: The left navigation panel containing personal information, filters, and section navigation
- **Mobile_Device**: Screen sizes at or below 1024px width (phones and tablets)
- **Desktop_Device**: Screen sizes above 1024px width
- **Hamburger_Button**: The three-line menu icon used to toggle sidebar visibility
- **Toggle_Button**: Any button that shows/hides the sidebar (hamburger or close button)
- **Sidebar_Manager**: The JavaScript class responsible for managing sidebar state and behavior

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the sidebar to start hidden with only a hamburger button visible, so that I can view content in full width and access navigation when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site on a mobile device, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL hide the sidebar completely by default
2. WHEN the sidebar is hidden on mobile, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL display only the hamburger button in the top-left corner
3. WHEN a user taps the hamburger button on mobile, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL show the sidebar with a semi-transparent overlay
4. WHEN the sidebar is open on mobile, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL display the existing collapse button (<<) inside the sidebar
5. WHEN a user taps the collapse button or overlay on mobile, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL hide the sidebar and show only the hamburger button again

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the sidebar to be visible by default but collapsible, so that I can choose to hide it for distraction-free reading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site on desktop, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL display the sidebar in full view by default
2. WHEN the sidebar is visible on desktop, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL show a collapse button (arrow or hamburger) inside the sidebar
3. WHEN a user clicks the collapse button on desktop, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL hide the sidebar and show a floating toggle button
4. WHEN the sidebar is hidden on desktop, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL display a floating hamburger button to restore the sidebar
5. WHEN a user clicks the floating button on desktop, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL show the sidebar again with the collapse button visible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the sidebar behavior to be consistent and predictable without the system remembering my preferences, so that the interface behaves the same way every time I visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits or refreshes the site, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL always start with the default state (hidden on mobile, visible on desktop)
2. WHEN a user resizes the browser window, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL reset to the appropriate default state for the new screen size
3. WHEN the sidebar state changes, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL NOT store any preferences in localStorage or cookies
4. WHEN a user navigates between pages, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL reset to the default sidebar state for each page
5. WHEN the page loads, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL ignore any previously stored sidebar preferences

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all toggle buttons to work correctly and provide clear visual feedback, so that I can easily control the sidebar visibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any toggle button is clicked or tapped, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL immediately respond by changing sidebar visibility
2. WHEN the hamburger button is visible, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL provide visual feedback when pressed but maintain the hamburger icon
3. WHEN the sidebar is open, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL use the existing collapse button (<<) for closing rather than changing the hamburger icon
4. WHEN toggle buttons are hovered (on desktop), THE Portfolio_Website SHALL provide visual feedback with color or shadow changes
5. WHEN toggle buttons are pressed, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL provide immediate visual feedback before the sidebar animation starts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and responsive sidebar animations that don't interfere with content interaction, so that the interface feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar opens or closes, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL complete the animation within 300ms
2. WHEN the sidebar is animating, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL prevent multiple rapid toggle attempts that could break the animation
3. WHEN the sidebar opens on mobile, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL fade in the overlay smoothly in sync with the sidebar slide
4. WHEN the sidebar closes on mobile, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL fade out the overlay and slide the sidebar simultaneously
5. WHEN the main content area adjusts for sidebar changes on desktop, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL animate the margin changes smoothly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sidebar behavior to be implemented with clean, maintainable code that doesn't conflict with existing functionality, so that the codebase remains stable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar manager initializes, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL detect device type accurately using consistent breakpoints (1024px)
2. WHEN device type changes due to window resize, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL cleanly reset to the appropriate default state
3. WHEN sidebar state changes, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL update all relevant ARIA attributes and CSS classes consistently
4. WHEN the sidebar manager handles events, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL prevent event bubbling and handle edge cases gracefully
5. WHEN the sidebar functionality is tested, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL work correctly with or without JavaScript enabled

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the sidebar controls to be fully accessible and provide appropriate feedback, so that I can navigate the site effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN toggle buttons are rendered, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL provide descriptive ARIA labels that indicate current state and action
2. WHEN the sidebar state changes, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL update aria-expanded attributes on all relevant toggle buttons
3. WHEN the sidebar is open, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL set appropriate aria-hidden values on the sidebar and overlay elements
4. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL provide clear focus indicators on all toggle buttons
5. WHEN the Escape key is pressed while the sidebar is open, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL close the sidebar and return focus appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to integrate seamlessly with the existing theme system and responsive design, so that it looks and feels like a natural part of the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is displayed, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL use only existing theme colors and design tokens
2. WHEN toggle buttons are styled, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL follow the existing button design patterns and hover states
3. WHEN the sidebar overlay is shown on mobile, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL use theme-appropriate opacity and colors
4. WHEN animations occur, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL use the existing CSS custom properties for timing and easing
5. WHEN the sidebar layout changes, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL maintain proper spacing and typography from the design system
